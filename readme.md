# General Info

This repository contains the code developed during my bachelor's thesis at TU Wien in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics. It encompasses a tool designed for manipulating density profiles and gaining insights into their influence on the bootstrap current.

# How To Use
